## I‚Äôm Jaime Eduardo Navarrete üëã
### About Me üîß

I design solutions for data acquisition from physical systems through hardware and software integration.
Rather than labeling myself strictly as a "programmer," I see myself as a problem solver for data acquisition ‚Äî someone who learns and applies the necessary knowledge to tackle real-world challenges.

Over the years, I have worked extensively with:

* Programming tools: Python (since 2021), Object Pascal ‚Äì Delphi (since 2001), LabVIEW (since 1998), Matlab (since 1997)

* HMI development for industrial and laboratory applications in Lua (since 2013)

* Integration of hardware and software for reliable measurement systems (since 1999)

### Data Acquisition Expertise üìä

I have hands-on experience designing and implementing data acquisition systems for a wide range of physical variables, including all common measurements in industrial environments such as Pressure, Temperature, pH, RPM, Dissolved Oxygen, and Turbidity.

Additionally, I have some hands-on experience in image analysis for laboratory applications.

This expertise allows me to bridge the gap between sensors, hardware, and intelligent software, ensuring accurate and reliable information flow from the physical world to decision-making systems.

### Academic Background üéì

I hold a PhD in Chemical Engineering, with specialization in:

* Classical Control (PID, cascade, etc.)

* Advanced Control (Predictive and Adaptive Control)

* System Identification for dynamic modeling of physical and chemical processes

This strong academic background complements my engineering experience, enabling me to design robust and scalable solutions that meet industrial demands.

### From Lab to Industry ‚öôÔ∏è

By combining my Data Acquisition Expertise with my Academic Background in control and system identification, I deliver solutions that:

* Enhance process monitoring and automation

* Enable predictive and adaptive control strategies

* Provide scalable architectures for industrial and laboratory environments

* Transform raw sensor data into actionable insights for decision-making

## In short
**I bring the rigor of research and the practicality of engineering to create innovative solutions for industrial challenges ‚Äî measuring the real world to enable better decisions about it.**
